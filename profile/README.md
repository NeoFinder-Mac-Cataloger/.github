## What is NeoFinder?

NeoFinder is a robust and efficient digital asset management application designed exclusively for macOS. It quickly catalogs your disks, folders, and external volumes, creating a comprehensive and searchable database of all your files. With NeoFinder, you can instantly locate any document, image, video, or audio file without needing the original storage device connected.

The application offers powerful search tools, customizable cataloging options, and support for a wide range of file formats.

NeoFinder is an indispensable tool for photographers, videographers, archivists, and anyone who works with large collections of digital files. Its ability to organize, search, and manage assets saves valuable time and streamlines creative workflows on Mac.
